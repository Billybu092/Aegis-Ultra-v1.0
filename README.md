## 🔍 Overview
Aegis Ultra is a high-performance, single-file PowerShell engine designed to provide deep visibility into Windows systems. It focuses on security posture, system hygiene, and operational transparency. 

Unlike "cleaners" or "boosters," Aegis Ultra follows a Safe-by-Default philosophy—it performs deep audits using native Windows components without modifying registry settings or deleting user data.

## ✨ Core Features
* System Topology Audit: Real-time hardware identity and memory load analysis.
* Network Perimeter Analysis: External IP detection and firewall status verification.
* Defense Posture Check: Real-time monitoring of Windows Defender and BitLocker protection.
* Integrity Verification: Automated SFC (System File Checker) background scans with a functional progress bar.
* Sophisticated UI: "Elite" hacker-style console with animated progress bars and spinners.
* Enterprise Logging: Continuous auditing with logs stored in C:\ProgramData\AegisUltra.
